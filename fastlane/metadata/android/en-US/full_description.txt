MicroTempo is an ultra-precise chronograph app that displays time synchronized via raw SNTP protocol at true microsecond precision with smooth 90Hz animations.

Features:
• Microsecond precision via custom SNTP implementation
• Reads NTP fractional seconds (bytes 44-47) for ~232ps resolution
• Burst sampling: keeps lowest-RTT sample for accuracy
• Auto-resync every minute to compensate for quartz drift
• Terraluna-inspired regulator dial with Arabic-Indic numerals
• Perpetual calendar with outsize date, day, month, and leap year indicator
• Lunar phase indicator from wttr.in weather data
• Weather display (temperature and conditions)
• Multiple NTP server selection (Google, Cloudflare, Apple, NTP Pool, NIST)
• Leap smear support indication
• Zero external NTP library dependencies
• Dark theme optimized for AMOLED screens

Technical highlights:
• Custom SNTP client (~120 lines) using standard JDK DatagramSocket
• Thread-safe atomic offset storage with lock-free reads
• Zero-allocation frame loop for smooth 90Hz rendering
• Resource-safe socket handling with automatic cleanup
